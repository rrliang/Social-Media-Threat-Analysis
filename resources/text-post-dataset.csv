ammonia on them while making sure he doesn't inhale any. I would shoot him in his

Resume
Griefing: I like to take my time in order to cause the most damage, but I have attacked
many servers with a hit-and-run style of disruption before and caused massive amounts of
damage. I would like to say that my best griefing attack was the Scattered Space incident,
although the damage wasn't intense compared to most of my attacks on servers, I stirred
up plenty of drama in their community.
Cooperation: I would like to think myself as that of a rogue in many situations, but I have
shown to be able to work with others. Considering our personalities, I don't think I would
have any troubles with group raiding.
Admins: I can bullshit my way out of things, but I am a honest man. If I focus, I can have
a silver tounge that avoids truthfulness.
I hope that this information is enough to provide and I hope in the future I can infest the
world one day."

1	I got suspended from school for a week in april for wearing a black duster.
1	"July 26th, 2012
In my dream, I went into a bizarre dimension with blue spots in terrain, Rocky Black and
grey terrain, and a cloudy black sky. I didn't see the sky, but out of nowhere, a powerful
being appeared to me, and the sky had a thin plate of volcanic, powerful orange (gaseous
like) material. The being spoke to me words with power, which I can't really recall. In my
next dream, I was awake, in my bed, and there was an alien there. I was being hooked
with wires to my brain, sort of feeding me information. It was feeding me dreams within
my own dream, kind of like inception. In this dream thing, I was studying the possible
amount of dreams. There was a chart, like the audacity ogg vorbis specs one. There was a
limit to dreams and personality, according to the info.
The info I remember is:
Personality: 136,742
Dreams: 144 million or more (relative to your body? Or could it be more?)
There was another dream about school. See, last year, I dropped back in after dropping
out from absolute f'ing hell. I usually saw this poor bloke while passing to the next
class. Probably 14 or 15, but he barely did anything to warrant any bullying, yet he got so
much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for everything. I've probably interacted with the kid 3 times; the 1st was seeing some of my friends trying to cheer him up, the 2nd was seeing him get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed
with by some jock idiots, in which I pulled a knife on them and intimidated them into
leaving, and the 3rd was where he had this delicate science project, so I basically daunted
the idiots in the middle of the hallway into getting to class and made sure that this kid's
project wasn't ruined by D-bags.
In my thoughts, I could just see myself at an earlier age in the kid. So, the dream directed
my mind into the social 'chart' of the kid and the students in general, in which I just kind
of got a broader social look in people; i.e. being able to 'put myself into other people's
shoes'. I worked and thought and came up with a moral that I really need to reach that kid
and prevent anything bad from happening, because I don't want someone to have to deal
with the mentality that can develop from that.
The dream flashed to another dream, which was a type of mind probe in a way. I just felt
like I was being read. I was having to face my own flaws in a very disturbing and hostile
state of REM.
I kind of woke up and still felt the alien type thing (Probably caused from human natural
DMT from last sentence) glaring at me. It kind of had that 'snobby' or arrogant type of

point in dishing out $30k a year just to get into college, only for most people to either
drop out or get a useless degree, or something they're not entirely interested in.
I don't think everything should be free, but there's one thing that absolutely must be-
Education. Primary and Secondary school is free for students, which is excellent because
every human deserves the chance and the right to be educated.
Yet in college, most the time it's going into a huge room with a hundred other students,
taking notes of what the professor says, and then studying your ass off to try to actually
pass the class. A lot of times, the teachers aren't even good at teaching in the first place.
Yet in Elementary ~ High, you have teachers working their ass off, helping each student at
the rise of a hand.
So normally school only costs tax payers. You get all the help you need for free, during
class. You can fuck up all you want.
College, you pay a FUCKLOAD of $$$ for, get shitty teachers, have to do everything
yourself, and have a low chance of success.
In america, College is Bullshit!"

Divorce
The effects of divorce are extensive and cause a lot of conflict on families. Elliot Rodger

1	"Women have always had it easy. Us men cannot have any emotion, we have to be into
sports and killing, and we have to be strong. Women are only expected to use up our
resources and -- in a distant past, take care of the family unit.
Modern women, however, don't raise their kids. I know my little brother's best friend lived
in a household with a single mother. She was 250+ pounds, made him do all of the chores
and cleaning, and ignored the two youngest children. Those kids have spent most of their
time playing video games instead of being taught values and morality. They will not have
anything to reflect back on when they are older, and it is likely they will grow up weaker
physically and mentally than would be.
That single mother? She married a jock football player at age 17, only to divorce him 8
years later and stunt the family. 50$ says she probably had some nice guy friends who she
neglected or treated like shit. If she married one of the nerds / nice guys, I'd guarantee the
entire family would be better off.
Women ignore and bully nice guys, and leave them to be rather miserable and rejected
for their lifetime. The intellectuals and benevolent people usually never get laid and
get bullied well into adulthood. It doesn't really change after high school. Yet retards,
gearheads, and douchebags get rewarded for their idiocies.
This is evidence enough that women are stupid. Dish in the constant nagging, gold-
digging, manipulating, hypersexuality, cheating and so many other aspects of the typical
'liberated' woman, and anyone who doesn't have their head in their ass will agree that
civilization has a major moral crisis going on.
And yet for what I have just said, I would be shunned by most people, even though it's the
reality. P.C. degenerates are destroying society."
1	"I'm against gay marriage because I do not want them to experience the soul crushing pain
that follows a long time committed relationship, just for 99% of them to fail. All that hard

by corrupt avarice.
If gay people had to suffer the romance us straight people live, then they wouldn't be
happy anymore, and I cannot let that happen. They are too precious."

play on my own save. I didn't finish it much, but I did re-discover it at age 8. It was one

The people who are against abortion are usually people who should've been aborted in the

Children are savages, and they're gonna grow up to be douchebaggy parasites anyways.
They should be exterminated from an early age. Obviously, not all children; not all people
are inherintely evil and parasitic in nature. Anyone who is a benevolent or intelligent
person deserves a chance at life. However, who should be the judge for who will live or
die? All the nerds are too uptight to ever carry this out, so now we got stuck with the bush
presidency and they are the enbodiment of stupidity. This obeezy presidency is just bush
2.0, so I doubt the MASTER's plan of UNITY and PURIFICATION will ever come to
fruition.
As for euthanasia, life is horrible. Just because the majority of people can get laid and have
everything handed to them and live in heaven, doesn't mean 100% of people will. Even
in the first world, there's so much injustice. Like people living past age 30 still as virgins

In this town (flora vista)..
#1. I have no education. I dropped out of AHS back in ~10, then was forced to attend again
and dropped out again in ~12. I had a 3.5 GPA but the culture there was backwards as hell,
as if it was stuck in the 1950s. Nothing but savages and douchebags. I never motivated
myself to get a GED, I need the forced classes and structure of school, but couldn't deal
with all the methheads, roughnecks and rednecks.
#2. I have no job, I tried to apply at a few places, Wendys, General Dollar, and Dairy
Queen. All rejected lol And besides, I don't have the strength to deal with those people,
I can be a hard worker, but I got real bad social anxiety, hate and fear of all these people.
Plus I don't got a phone to keep in touch with the boss if they force me to go in for
overtime. I got a nocturnal schedule anyways. No car though, nor a license.
#3. I have no friends here. All my friends are digital now, only time in life that I had a
social life were the times I didnt live in the four corners. I tried a lot during my childhood
in this area. But let me just put it this way- one of my friends and their little brothers and
sisters, stealthily stole my Playstation 1 I had since the 90s, along with dozens of games -
all which could be worth thousands of dollars nowadays.
During high school, the other borrowed my N64 and games over the summer, promising
to return them once school started again, and guess what the jackass did? He sold it to a
guy in denver for $200. Didn't even give me any of the dough. Then threatened to kick my
ass when I defended myself from some hicks.
The others talked crap behind my back.. There was a time though around 4/20/12 when
I got high with a few people out in the hills. One of the kids lived a few houses down and
when I dropped out didn't even stop over to say hello.
I may not seem the type, but I've been somewhat outgoing, friendly, a joker. I wasn't
that kid who actively avoided people all the time and dressed in all black and listened to
goth music. I went in, did my damned work, made straight A's then went home to a crap
abusive family and did more work and surfed the net.
My point? I tried to socialize in this shit town but to no avail.
#4. Major Depression, large amounts of anger and hatred, lots of boredom.. I used to cure
it through bong hits and video games but I cant even find those enjoyable anymore.
My dad's a fat lazy idiot who watches fox news all day, weighs 350 pounds and throws
hissy fits over everything. Never even bothered to help me get my drivers license and I'm
not entitled or spoiled or anything, I'd gladly get a job and pay for my own car.
My moms a psycho hillbilly drunk from florida who's really mentally ill. She smokes and
drinks a lot and smells disgusting, and has no manners whatsoever. The most hillbilly
accent you can imagine.
My bro is an antisocial douche with no education at 27. He's a user, always manipulating
people and draining their resources. He moved back in to this crap house with his wife
who bored 2 kids from some other guy, ex-meth, no education either.
I got literally 0 contacts and I'm too lazy to get a GED.
Look, I'm sorry if I'm rude and hateful or anything, but I don't know what to do. I've lived
no life for nearly 19 years, most of which was in the miserable ass sun-belt. Did you know
new mexico has the fourth highest suicide rate?
I don't know if I'm even gonna get an education. I don't want to sound dumb but going
into the wild is another option, but I'm thinking of getting a truck with those roofed
installations on the back, then putting a bed in there and driving out of new mexico.
the DMV is being whiny and asking for a proof of bank account and proof of rent or
something; they're one of the worst DMVs out there and that's saying something, eh?
I am the only atheist I know in my town, and I've had knives pulled on me over it. If I do
drift, I need a gun, a water purifier, medkit and some MREs. I've been thinking of driving
to either the Denver area, San Jose, CA, Oregon, Washington, or Maine. I'd love to become
a Canadian resident, but I gotta get a GED, get accepted into a 4 year college before I have
any chances. It'd be nearing the 2020s before that.
Every day I wake up filled with misery, boredom and hatred. In fact, I spent most of the
2010s only on youtube, barely any forums, or in school where I was pretty miserable. I do
get out of the house every day, where I take 2~4 hour walks to shed off some pounds and
build stamina.
Here's my area. I dont like giving out personal info too much but I just want to prove my
point. I live in the heart of the southwest, with no cities for like 200 miles in any direction.
This causes an effect where the area I'm in is extremely rural. With the mormon influence
of utah, it also makes it really republican, like 80%. Everyone does meth, tobacco like
crazy, lots of alcohol etc. AHS had a graduation rate of like 50%.
Should I escape this dump or deal with it? How can I become polite and make some
friends out there in this world?"
1	"Well IRL on my 13th birthday back in belen I had some good friends over, we were playing

was screwing up and there was a much more eerie presence then I saw this fucking
masked demon in the top-corner of the den.
After then I always had a fear of corners and saw that mask sometimes but always had
dreams about it. I remember one of my nightmares had it trap me through all the video
games I played except it would corrupt and distort them. So I was playing OOT and saw
that dante ghost suddenly attack me, where all 20 of my hearts quickly drained, at 2 hearts

Well generation Z (late 90s~10s) births grew up with a developed internet. They were

wasn't that much about socialization.
Everything is all white and high-def, dumbed down; there's not much spirit to anything
anymore. Marilyn manson used to be extremely offensive to a lot of people but now
nobody cares except some idiot right-wingers from rural areas still stuck in the 1950s.
I don't want to be insulting even more, but it's the parent's faults, for they are the ones to
raise them. A lot of the parents are immature and careless themselves. You see this all the
time where little girls are dressed in miniskirts and slut clothing with neon pink. It is an
absolute disgrace.
Lots of kids are savages. Remember south park's episode about how gingers had no souls?
Well now all the kids will fucking tear red haired people apart for something extremely
insignificant. I remember going to the mall with my older bro and overhearing some
stupid teenagers talking about that one 'friday' music video - and how they enjoyed it.
I'm not saying all Gen-zers are stupid spoiled brats; not all millenials are entitled and
think they're better than everyone. And not all GG's are stuck in the past and want to kill
all arabs and 'japs'.
But a lot of them are like it! We're living in the best time in human history; clean food,
vaccines, technology. But yet, people are becoming antisocial douchebags. Why can't
we be excellent to eachother and unite as a society? It's not like we're gonna be living
like kings forever, we're probably gonna fuck up the planet and cause ww3, or become
a emotionless, robotic society void of any spirit, with .1% of people ruling every single
aspects of our lives. 1984-esque"

Redneck/Roughnecks. They're the stereotypical hillbillies you can find all over america;
you either love sports and obsess over them or they'll collectively beat you up. Out here in
the heart of the southwest, I deal with a unique type of hillbilly- one that has adapted to
the harsh, inhospitable desert. At least the south has forests, ocean, beaches and swamps..
This town is 200 miles away from any city; it's right in the middle of nowhere and
culturally, it's still stuck in the 1950s. Gays, Minorities, atheists.. they'd get lynched. In fact
they actually lynched a transgender navajo a decade back. The place is pretty much 99%
mormon, 80% conservative/republican, everyone does meth or tobacco, they're rednecks
to the extreme! It's an oil town as well, no other jobs.
They all annoy and anger me to the max; if I didn't drop out of the world, I'dve done some
horrible things."

continue to erode society. The western world is degenerating and rotting, as China

It's about time we take up some arms! If these fucks are gonna dox me, I'm gonna
fucking hunt them down like the prey they are. I love my country! I will not stand to allow
these america-haters to continue to pollute my empire! Well, if I kill people I'll just go to an american prison and nobody wants that huh? So I'll just post offensive shit on the net
instead.
In all honestly, I think they need to legalize prostitution. Give these virgins in the gaming
industry some escorts instead of ugly fat feminists. The escorts are sexually experienced.
The feminists have a good chance to be.. not only inexperienced, but to cut your chode off.
They'd also yell at you constantly.
I want actual equality and equal responsibilities. Feminists nowadays want to create this
nightmarish 1984 authoritarian matriarchal degenesis. I know most of you probably got
like brown hair and neckbeards or something. You have no experience with firearms. But
it's about time you start training, because when the civil war comes in like 20 years, I want
to ensure the feminists don't win. Remember, use hollow points!"

1	"[Commenting on the movie Bang Bang Youâ€™re Dead:]
Another documentary to archive. I'll definitely check it out!
Aight now I'm done with all those posts so let me move back to discussing Jeff Weise. I
don't give a fuck about the new stigma of giving attention to killers, as it's going to happen
anyways. Let me just say I bet green money Jeff knew if he just killed himself he wouldn't
be remembered by more than like a dozen people. All who gave him shit wouldn't
care and would laugh at him anyways and think of him as weak. You cannot hope for
any decency from a bunch of scumbags who lack any form of empathy anyways. Mass
murderers kill for fame.
I know its a bit out of place to write a TL;DR piece about jeff on another article, but
whatever. If you look at the area where he lived, it's on a native american reservation. I live
near the largest one in the US, the navajo nation. There's a huge crime rate there, with
extreme homicide/suicide rates, and everyone is dirt poor. It's a fucking 3rd world country
in the middle of fucking nowhere (arizona). Now imagine instead of a desert wasteland, a
cold, (even more) isolated place far from a city.
Imagine all the pain 'regret' went through. His parents dying, having only his
grandparents to depend on, in the middle of nowhere back before the internet became
super-social. Of course when he went postal it did get 15 minutes of fame, but nobody
knows who he is... because he isn't some suburban white boy. There's a bias on other
races.
Come next march, it will be 10 years since his death! That's an entire decade that's passed.
If ghosts exist, that means the bloke had to deal with a decade of extra misery, now
possibly tormented by 8 victims.
As for the kid who went postal today, he only killed like 3 so it's not sufficient enough to
become a household name. Since he's white if he just dished in 6 more souls the circus
would be in full swing..."

1	"[On the topic of Columbine:]
You might not wanna admit it, but those 2 fuckers had style. Most of these events
has some pissed off depressed kid go and kill like 2~3 people. Some who are actually
competent, like lanza or cho, kill dozens, but leave behind nothing but incoherent
ramblings. The columbine weirdos did their act right around the turn of the millenium,
in a suburban culture-war area, filled with uptight soccermom cunts, and had carefully
manipulated everyone and everything into order. They carried lots of knives, and 99
bombs. If their propane bombs detonated, there'd be 450+ deaths from the blasts alone.
They also left behind journals, videos, etc. Plus the police report was like 20,000 pages
long. Waco made a dent in the american morale, mcveigh left a bigger one. Columbine
ruined school even further, and issued in a huge ass moral panic. A generation later,
columbine is still a household name, and nobody remembers that word for the beautiful
flower you can find in colorado, but for that event that happened a fuckin decade and'a'
half ago.
tl;dr all these kids know about it even though they were like toddlers back then, because
it's still very famous today. They look up to the killers because they were bullied and
got revenge on the system (school) that torments them. Little do these kids know that
the killers murdered mostly innocent people; A students. Like I said, go look up Daniel
Mauser and Dave Sanders while you're reading this. You owe the victims that attention."

abusive then getting in a car crash and being permanently disabled I think, living in that
native american reservation where like most of the students were suicidal, and it had a
low graduation rate. That kid was an outcast in that town, and had a hellish life, even after
that shit happened he was still mostly ignored after the media shitstorm faded. I dont
believe in glorifying violence but the right thing to do is to have pity and empathy for who
that guy was.. but not necessarily what he became.
I don't intend to white knight or anything, but I'm very sympathetic to the pain and

back in 2009. The town was about 80% Hispanic, and most of the whites were old ww2
vets, so growing up there, I was a minority in school. I'm not going to tl;dr post but to
sum up, a lot of the students treated me like a second-class citizen.
There were about 5 major families which most people belonged to. If you got in a fight
with a Chavez, you could guarantee you'd make 200+ enemies, who have access to guns.
The police were often incompetent and corrupt, even before the crisis..
The staff in the schools, being part of the big 5, often were extremely corrupt themselves.
They also singled me out all the time because I was very unpopular (being non-religious
in a 90% catholic town), along with being the computer nerd, when most of the students
were in poverty..
For instance, back in 07 one of my best friends, Aaron was this short, akward African
American bloke. One of the ghetto scumbags punched him in the nose, causing severe
bleeding. It took 6 minutes for staff to get the situation addressed. The douchebag who

Being a cop would be a tough job, as you have to do a massive amount of paperwork,
risk your life often, and have the public's perception and opinion to worry about as well.
However, one cannot deny that there is a corruption problem going on.
In many ways, they have gotten better, and I suppose the opposite could be argued. It's
a bit macabre, but I was reading through the book of one of the fathers of the murdered
students at Columbine, and he described how the police sat outside for hours, as students
died brutally. Then the cops boasted about how they saved everyone.

One of the fights back in 4th grade where the jock douchebags ganged up on me and
fought against me. 5 vs 1, real fair. Or when in 6th grade I got socked out of nowhere by
some 15 year old flunkie drugged up douchebag, my entire right face was blood red, yet
I didn't feel any pain when I was pissed off and hit back, but over the next week it kinda
sucked. Getting socked out of nowhere again in 7th by another shithead, leaving a large
purple welt on my cheekbone. Also had knives pulled on me 4 times. I like how I got
in trouble too, and faced longer suspension times than any of the douchebags. Maybe
because no matter the race, everyone's related to eachother in this shit state so they look

Most violent crimes are down overall, except (most likely) in warzones like Chi-raq or
detroit.
However, mass shooting & mass murder incidents have sharply risen since Columbine;
Any significant massacre (6+ dead) usually triggers extreme shockwaves culturally, and
a lot of gun owners buy out as much fucking ammo as possible, causing these hikes in
prices. My original post was simply warning any future gun owners to be weary of any
tragedies that now occur much more frequently.
As if a thick storm was on the edge, that has now engulfed the area. Chances of lightning
striking are significantly higher now."
1	"I strongly suggest using .22's for hobbyists / beginners, for obvious reasons.
Get a .22 rifle for around $150-200 in america. The ammo is usually cheap, like $0.05-.08
for a standard quality .22 lr cartridge. Since mass murder is common now in america, a
lot of people usually buy up as much ammo as they can, leading to shortages and price
hikes, so take notice of these events and plan your wallet accordingly.
22 lr isn't very expensive, and is very great for target practice. If you need to defend
yourself, it is still quite capable of being fatal, but learn a mozambique drill.
If you just want a light-weight / agile / small self defense weapon, save up $500 for a .45
glock or something..

2007~2010 i had derek and a few other kids hang with me frequently
2010 i moved back here and barely had anyone hang out at all
2012 was done with education and became a neet
2014 my health rapidly delcined and mental state as well

to their home and my mom was all drunk and annoying and shit so i decided to walk 2
miles home
they werent able to find me by tyhe time they drove home
on the way home i asked 2 sillhouetes what time it was and shit
they were going to the skate park and it was int he direction of the park where i need to
cross to get home
then we got drunk and smoked some cigs with jane at the end
they hung out with me for a big as we ranted about this fuckin town bro

My brother made friends with the few geeky people in the town back when he was 19ish,

you gotta wave through all the shitheads before you find any real friends.
I've spent most of my life keeping my life to myself, I barely used blogger at all, and I kept
my personal details private from my closest internet allies, who I've been friends with

I'm sorry if I'm ranting or tl;dr'ing, and I probably should've kept this to myself, but I just
wanted to share the fact that I was able to socialize out of nowhere after a generation of
abuse from everyone, loneliness, being ignored all the time by my family, etc, and being
denied a normal life ya know?"

Sawed offs will fuck you up with the recoil, you can't be accurate AT ALL firing full auto,
and if you're going to shoot someone they're going to probably be fucked anyways, so why
not ease their suffering with an expanding bullet (HP) ?
I'm from a military background, I've shot guns a lot before, and understand how
dangerous they are, I dont buy into that ""Guns dont kill ppl, ppl kil ppl"" bullshit. Guns are
designed to kill, anyone who denies that is retarded to an extreme. But guns are power,
and it's who has the most power that matters. If I was able to carry a pistol with me, I'd
have the power to protect myself from all the countless thugs in this country, esp. this
state."

Fuck college/uni unless you're getting a STEM field; only the genuinely genius should be
going to college/uni in america, the way this failing hypercapitalist state is going. I could
go on for weeks about how corrupt and worthless most of the education system is for
most people, but 90% of us probably had firsthand experience with the typical american
school.
Tradition will always rule. Hard physical labour is always going to be the core foundation
for a civilization. These office jobs were a dream back in 50's america and all that, but now
they're mostly shitty jobs. You have the ass licking turbo-liberal degenerates deteriorating
society and poisoning culture and now all the jobs have sensitivity training, silencing,
little advancement..
I hate my town but all these oil workers are getting 40,000 a year in the first year of their
'career' in the oil fields. most americans on average only make HALF of that.
If you waste all that scholarship / middle/rich class parent's dough on a faggy little liberal
arts degeree, you deserve to work minimum wage through your 20s.
STEM and Strength leads the way.
Womens studies & art is only gay.
GET CERTIFIED. If you have a high school diploma, you AREN'T fucked. High school
dropouts can't get 90% of the jobs. Stay in school and deal with the bullshit, the bullies,
degenerates, just toughen up. Don't listen to the liberal agenda of being a pussy. If anyone
gives you shit, beat the shit out of them.
Social skills is 70% of what will make you succeed.
DON'T take the easy way out, for it'll be the hardest in the end.
Work your ass off, get a stem field, graduate from university there and make a 6 digit
figure.
and hell if you don't feel like going that far, get certified in welding, trucking, plumbing
or electronics. You'll make anywhere from $30~60,000 a year. WORK for the oil fields if
you can. It's scary and extreme work, but you can make 100,000 easily after a few months.
Underwater welding / alaska fishing is a massive amount of money that is well worth it.

1	"Violent media usually prevents real life violence and I can easily be generic and pull this
little chart out to prove it. (check the attached image) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8676954/Doom-creator-John-
Carmack-violent-video-games-reduce-real-world-aggression.html
Like I said earlier, a newly 13 yr old kid from my town downright killed himself. He had
a upper-middle class family (200,000 / yr ) .. which confuses me as to why they would
move to this ugly, redneck rundown desert shithole of a town.. Anyways, he fucking kills
himself from all the bullshit from the town.
I usually take daily walks, ever since 2014 when I stopped being as much as a shut-
in. I casually talk to a few people here and there. I remember having a few lengthy
conversations with folks, and when it was relevant to the subject being discussed, I
probably brought up the story of the kid a few times.
You know what they all said about that kid? He was a sinner and deserved it. Those
arent my words, they're the words of the redneck shitheads here. They're all mormon
psychopaths addicted to tobacco and meth driving shitty pickup trucks from the 70s.
You know the movie naoplean dynamtie? Imagine that but with 50x more hostility in the
rednecks, and all the scenery replaced by ugly light-tan wasteland covered with weeds
everywhere.
My point? you cant blame that kid for killing himself. I'm not supporting his decision,
because most suicidal people are usually good people at heart. Most victims of suicide
ARE NOT REMEMBERED. I've spoken to the parents of this child and inspired them
to do what the parents of Ryan Halligan did and perhaps make a memorial site and do
public speaking on behalf of the bloke.
Now with that being said, the bloke still had great parents and a nice house, but it's not
like that would really counter the fact that the people we're surrounded with are thrice as
scary as southerners.
Weise lived far away from a lot of american civilization in a fucking rez. You all know his
life story by now so it should be of no surprise why he was so dark and disturbed.
To wrap this tl;dr post up.. The reason why most modern mass murderers exist is because
they know for a fact that suicide alone would just leave them forgotten forever. But if they
pull the trigger and take out some random people with them, the media will make them
the talk of (not only the town) but the nation and perhaps even the world.
Red Lake was on-par with columbine, and yet only got 1% as much attention. You know
why? Because they were all native americans- minorities. Even still, a lot of people still
faintly remember it 10 years later. Imagine if weise never went postal. Maybe a dozen
would've known about it enough to turn a glance his way for a moment, maybe his
grandpa would care.
It's the killer's fault for the tragedy, but society's fault for making the killers.
As for anyone thinking violent video games cause real life violence.."
1	"[Regarding a post about Jeffrey Weise:]
Thanks for a decent nonbiased post that actually contributed to the thread bro.
Like I usually say, for this specific case (Red Lake) it's hard not to feel incredibly sorry for the bloke. Given his life circumstances, very few would've overcome those challenges and
horrible experiences to become a normal person.
If I had a decent family, great genetics and didnt live in a desert shithole state, I would've
had a future and a positive outlook on life too. Even small changes like a different location
around here would've had massive effects on my psyche.
When that guy had his dad kill himself, a drunk abusive shithead for a mom (Who
became disabled for life due to a car crash) and was forced to move to a indian reservation
you cant blame him for being violent and suicidal.
Like I said, I live near the largest native rez in the country. Even 20 miles from the border
in a small quiet town, there's still lots of corruption, suicidal people (a 13 year old boy
killed himself a while ago) and no real jobs. We're mostly white, if that says anything.
Even generic american whites are living in 3rd world conditions out here.
I'm not going to troll or be evil. Mass murder is inexcusable and absolutely never
commendable.
American and most western civilization isnt even really civil. You're on your own out here.
Few friends will back you up, most people's families are close-minded and horrible, and
we're no longer the great country we say we are, we're 2nd-class compared to much of
western europe. Unless you're making 250,000$ / yr as a family unit, you are no longer
the fabled middle class of the 20th century.
Lots of people say they help the depressed /suicidal, but very few seek to help them. Hell,
depression isnt constant sadness, at least once you hit adulthood. If weise stayed alive
another 5 years before commiting suicide he would've gone absolutely insane. Once
you're done with school, life goes from easy mode to insane mode."

Since this will be the first entry in this livejournal, I feel it important to include some sort
of introduction. My name is.. well, I'd rather not leave my personal details public on the
internet. Although it is just about 2016, and LJ's heyday is a decade old, I feel Livejournal
efficient enough for my goal of creating a virtual journal. I am undergoing this project in
the slight chance that I may perish. I would rather not be completely forgotten; I'd rather
leave some digital footprints for my family and friends and any lurkers. I do not suggest
that I'm likely to die anytime soon, considering the fact that I am barely in my 20s. This
project will allow me to exercise my brand-new keyboard (AULA model on sale for $22,
original price was $50,) and my writing capabilities. It will also be nice to look back on
this journal when I am an older adult. Since it isn't being written on paper, I will be able
to recover the data for as long as this site is up. I won't accidentally spill some juice on the
note and render it unreadable, or tear it up and throw it away; you understand the point I
make.
Now then, an entry..
Today's work
I usually keep a schedule on a notepad in real life where I document each day's tasks and
chores, so I'll emulate it here;
1. Encyclopedia Dramatica; I worked on a few of my own pages along with a half dozen
other ones
2. I continued to archive various documents relating to my research and interests
3. I used my alts to upvote my content (see: whiteknighting) on a specific gaming website
4. I did a moderate amount of exercise
5. I cleaned out my grandfather's WW2 military storage unit and reorganized the
materials within
6. I cleaned my room, paying close attention to every square inch of material to clean
7. I successfully stayed up 24 hours to shift myself back to a day-schedule
8. Did a bunch of chores
9. Cleaned up my desktop, deleted bad games / media to clear up space. Notably, I
uninstalled GMOD but discovered the addons and downloads were still there. After
deleting them, I freed up 28 GB of space
10. I archived some of my media...
And most importantly..
11. I made this livejournal account!
Notable Events
I've finally been able to get insurance that allows me to be able to afford dental appointments. My dental situation is equivalent to that of a pollack, and I need to get
my four wisdom teeth extracted on the 22nd. I hope this doctor doesn't fuck this up and
permanently damage my nerves or jaw.
What I have to sayNothing much for now. Time is like a river... When you're born it goes
slowly yet you don't even comprehend it; when you are finally able to see it when you're
a young child, it flows slowly and peacefully. When you're on the verge of adolescence,
it begins to pick up pace and it quickly becomes difficult to keep track of the rippling in
the water. When you hit an adult age (around 16), you'll find it going at a dozen times the
speed that it went by as a child. Eventually, it becomes impossible to keep track of the
details.
Just how much time has passed? The last time I was truly happy with existence.. 2008;
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 .. 7 fucking years.
My live has been a poor quality existence for the last 7 years. I have little faith my situation
is going to get better. The economy will probably never recover from the great recession.
The only people who will become president in the 2016 elections are Bernie Sanders,
Donald Trump, Hillary, or another Bush. Suffice to say, I have no faith whatsoever in my
nation anymore.
""The instrument of my resurrection was supposed to be freedom. But there isn't an
open sky or endless field to be found where I reside, nor is there light or salvation to be

impacted. I got a pollack's mouth but it isnt destroyed. I got like 5-6 cavities (3 are small)

1	"It has been a while since my last entry.. Today I'll cover the following subjects; Time,
Corruption, Life and Death. These are probably going to be the most recurring subject
matter if I continue to blog..
Firstly, it's been a very long time now. I remember 2007~09 like it was yesterday, and
yet I'm starting to lose much of my memory of that time period. Let's take a look at how
much time has passed;
2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015. So 11 entire years have
passed that I've lived in this state. More than half of my life has been spent in one of the
worst states in the entire country, and the USA is one of the largest nations in the world.
When you look at the list of years, 2005 is barely that far apart from 07, and yet 05 and
06 were probably the worst years I've went through. In less than a year now, I'll begin to
experience life a decade in the future from my heyday. A decade, in seemingly the blink of
an eye. It's crazy.
Hell, as I type this, it's already been 4 years since I've left school. Mass Effect 3 is almost
4 years old already! Skyrim is already at that point. Oblivion is going to be 10 YEARS OLD
in a few months. Xbox 360's already hit that point.
My grandfather died over 10 years ago.. My loyal companion, a fat, muscular golden cat
named Piggy has been 6ft under for 4 1/2 years now as well. Crazy..
Now.. looking into the future, I see no hope. The middle class continues to die, more
americans go on welfare or poverty, the rich grow in power, suicide and mass murder
skyrockets, USA loses it's power, etc. My predictions aren't even hypothetical; they're
already happening and have been for decades.
Society has also been corrupted and decayed. Nowadays it's not even uncommon for frikin
Pre-teens to lose their v-cards. It's disgusting. Most males are backstabbing betas, or
alpha assholes. It's rare to find a good friend nowadays. You have a 50% chance of being
divorced within like 5 years at this point by an american bride. The courts are 90% in her
favor for most shit as well.
Look at the military. PC now. You're more likely to commit suicide than to be KIA. You
get treated like fucking garbage by the country you stepped up to 'defend'. It's a fucking
shithole in america now, but you don't see europeans accepting any american refugees
or migrants. Instead these assclowns let in hordes of rapists and murderers. White civilization is cucked and fucked. The world is hence, not even worth living in anymore.

Already 40 days into this year, and I doubt it's going to get any better. I've been dealing
with a moderate sickness which has caused me to miss a dentist appointment. My front
teeth are starting to cause me severe pain when pressure or liquid makes contact which
shouldn't even be happening as the dentists did 2 hours of work on them a few weeks
ago. I just got 3 cavities left to patch up and my teeth will be alright, but enough about this
shit.
For the last few weeks, I've been playing the f *** out of Grand Theft Auto IV. It's just
about 8 years old now, but I'm still finding new things every time I play. I must confess
that despite now owning GTA 5 (due to a friend gifting me it on steam), I've never beat it.
Up until I was gifted it, I never even touched the game. Despite the fact that 5 is superior
to 4 in most ways, I still find more enjoyment in GTA 4; 280+ hours of it to be precise.
Suffice to say, I'm addicted to Liberty City, and all the fucked up freaks and events that
take place within this virtual world.
Through the near-decade long time I've spent on IV, I mostly frequented the southern
half of the eastern borough, and downtown 'manhatten' and the central park. Lately,
I've been exploring the smaller obscure islands and finding a lot of shit. I modded some
health / armor regen scripts to make the game a hell of a lot less tedius, but practically
doubled the damage of the weapons and vastly expanded the range of them; the sawed
off shotgun is capable of downing someone over 200m from you (although it is VERY
unlikely due to the spread)
I've been going on GTA 4's internet and browsing these sites. I've found shit I never read
before. GTA 4 is on par with TES 4 on the amount of shit you can still discover. I was
reading blogs in game and legit threw up from one of them. It was basically some ugly
fat feminist furfag cunt talking about her perverted sexual activity with someone else and
dousing each other with dishwasher liquids. I'm just sitting here thinking.. Someone
employed at Rockstar North is even more fucked up in the head than I am. My writing
shifts more towards patrick bateman / ER shit. This rockstar jackass is just a perverted
troll with a way-overactive imagination. Fucker should see a shrink.
Well, 2007 is already 8~9 years old. It's scary to me how time just flew by. I always bitch
about how my future is bleak, and indeed the entire nation and world's is (unless you're a spoiled fucking cunt, in which case check your privileged for real, asshole) but I know I'm
not the only one thinking this shit. Obama's got less than a year left in office now. GTA 5
is already 2 years old man.. fucking hell.
Those days as a kid in that ALB Metro house, with the two fireplaces, the large den; the
cozy old-school feel.. It's not even close to recent anymore. All this time I've spent as a
shut-in / NEET / outcast.. I remember a time before social media and smartphones. Chad
and Chloe weren't entirely fucking brainless zombies addicted to their screens. They're
still normies though, so they're still absolute scum of the earth who deserve nothing but
a few stabs into their jugular vein. What I'm trying to show you is, the world's a different
place than it was when I was growing up. We're seeing Global warming finally having
some serious effects. We got the USA at the quality of a 3rd world country now, with a
middle class minority, severe poverty, accelerating crime and corruption and the greatest
security state in the world's history on the horizon. Just for typing in these buzzwords,
I'm now on a couple more watchlists, and nobody is going to be reading this shit anyways
except you NSA ass clowns.
Here's something to rustle your jimmies. If I was to reenact the shit I've been doing in
GTA 4, in the real world, I'd probably have a 7-fuckin' star wanted level. I've been going
around driving over thousands of NPCs in central park over and over for shits and giggles,
acting out an ""anders"" dozens of times, beating the shit out of random fuckers and other
shenanigans.
Not much else I feel I should type out anyways. It's already TL;DR but perhaps one of the
JIDF rats or creepy faggots from my past might be lurking around. In which case.. I hope
you enjoy this entry you crazy ass motherfuckers."

jacked off a lot but I didnt really feel that good from it. personal info but whatever. I've
been having intense nostalgia for RTB 1.045.. so eventually I felt like loading it up.
When I did, guess what? There were actually other people playing! It was none other than
my dear friend RanGun. Ran and I go back a decade. Anyways I know it was fate for us to
meet up again man, it was fun. We had a long ass talk, catching up. Learned a lot about
his personal situation nowadays. He's going to sleep now, I prob will too. Its 6:30 am so I

1	"It's been around two months since my last entry. As usual, time is fucking flying, societal
deterioration accelerating, and the collective IQ of the american collective declining.
I will not give exact details, but a mindfuck IRL happened. I quickly JIDF'd a lot of my
troll dust, and have been going incognito a lot more.
My childhood game was briefly revived for a little bit again; I brought in my longtime
friends to play it again, and some kids from the newer version of it checked on the
original. In total, probably 10 people went through my server. I directed a few projects;
recreations of Venice, a Medieval-oriented map, an underwater city (not worked on), along
with other projects. This was a game that was pretty much abandoned (Besides a small
group of people) since 2008, revived with some activity after nearly a decade of rot. I feel
blessed to have experienced some fresh memories of the game.
I'm considering maybe making a blog about the game but I know for a fact nobody would
visit it. Hell, I know for the most part I'm talking to myself on this ""blog"" here, but oh
well.
I'm not trying to talk to myself; I'm trying to document my experiences, and to give some
words of wisdom to you.
I've been neglecting some of my most important work, so I need to knock some sense in
myself. I've done plenty of internet archiving for now, and I've cleaned up one of my more
favourite sites, even if some of the mods and admins on it are autistic cunts. But, nowhere
online is safe from these kinds of people.
It is nearly summer 2016. Time flies fast..
I wont say too much about my personal life as I have plenty of enemies, especially
nowadays.

1	"It's been about a month since the last entry, save 3 days. I'm currently cooking up some
dinner while I type this but noone gives a damn. A lot has happened in this month, so
far...
One of my good friends, whom I've barely known for less than a year, yet has risen to
be one of my bros, challenged me to a debate. He is of a religion I won't specify (it's not
islam, dont worry) but was challenging my lack of faith in any paranormal / spiritual shit.
So he told me to do a mental ritual. I did, and I asked for what I want (Success with my
endeavors, and meeting girls). I had a 10/10 luck streak that lasted a week. In that time...
5 of the ladies I knew, sent me nudes (each one of them) and got comfortable sexting with
me.
One young woman I know IRL, will be visiting me after this semester's out, and will be
making my life the best it's been since 2008.
I became an admin of a very notable site.
After thinking about a specific reservation and the tragedy that befell them (early in may,
a similar tragedy effected the rez Im from), I found some random Native American dude
on omegle. I went on there to troll but instead had a good conversation with this dude.
He talked to me about how 6 of his friends chose to end it. He is from the poorest rez in
america yet made it to college. Kudos to him.
I talked to a very famous dude (hint: 2011, retaliation against some faggy little bully) for
40 minutes. I went on to skype some chick but she went to bed; instead, the famous dude
was on for once. He allowed people to add him on skype, so I did; I thought it was an
impostor but it was actually him. I brought up the dude I met yesterday, and the famous
dude told me how he talked 13 people out of becoming an hero. Good job man.
I made one of the girls I know into a sort of girlfriend, the first time I had one since 2009.
The luck wore out after a week but I still pray to the specific 'subjects' that I did when I
did the meditation-focus experiment. 666"

School shooters do it cus they cant get laid
Columbine opened the floodgates / pandora's box. The amount of infamy (on par with
9/11) they got inspired literally thousands of alienated youth into mass violence.
Most school shooters, and a big chunk of mass shooters, cite them as direct inspiration.
violence is the answer if it's self defense
being a retard and murdering everything isn't
most school shooters never kill the people who actually bullied them. Look at Columbine
where they spared the one guy who directly fucked them over. Then 99% of the victims
were high-IQ nerdy types in the library
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush; fuck Bush!
Until they bring our troops home, come on, justâ€”
SUICIDE PILLS
MASS MURDER PILLS
they did it for the lulz
Protip to all you totalitarian morons.
The vast majority (like 86%) of school shooters were bullied, often to an extreme.
Bullying, isolation, alienation = lower life span and a fucked up mentality
Relatively lax gun laws won't automatically result in massive homicide rates, but it
definitely helps more nutjobs get armed. However, look how the gun-free-countries
often fare in homicide rates compared to somewhere like Germany, Norway, Finland or
Switzerland, where guns are relatively common and purchaseable. It's the people, not the
laws, people.
Most of school is a fucking nightmare equivalent to prison if you're even an iota unique
or individualistic. This creates a false mentality of what the world is (the real world is still
shit but nothing compared to school) which causes the already mentally fragile bullied
outcasts to become even more alienated and unstable.
Mass shooters / school shooters are given (or at one point, were, before it became an
every-3-second occurance) massive amounts of fame, fangirls, news coverage, etc-
attention they were usually neglected IRL- or rather, the attention they receive is often
negative in nature.
So what would a tl;dr sensible method of reducing the amount of school shootings be? I
got a solution and nobody's gun rights or freedom of expression has to be fucking taken
away by you leftist twats or right wing religious nutjobs.
1. Actually do something about bullying. We don't have to turn our schools into
1984-esque nanny/prison states even more than they already are. Teachers should just
punish bullying for fucking once instead of doing literally nothing to prevent or punish it.
Not that hard, morons. Usually the teachers went out of their way to cover up and protect
the bullies when I was in school, often punishing the victims and treating them as they
were the cause; gaslighting. Course I grew up in a redneck shithole small town that was
stuck in the 50~80s, a stereotypical 80s movie high school.
2. Stop making mass murderers into fucking celebrities. Ghost / blacklist their names.
3. Reform and expand mental healthcare and coverage for as many people as possible.
Bring back institutionalization and effective treatment programs for the societal ills to
keep them from hurting themselves or others, and to help them become productive
societal units.
4. Be excellent to each other.
Not that hard, most people are just pinheads.
However, it is in human nature to persecute the different sheep of the tribe, either into
becoming great leaders or into suicide or violence.
It's in human nature to glorify violence and mass killers.
Humanity is just as primitive, chaotic and violent as the universe's creation. We'll always
be a bunch of crazy ass chimps goin all out.
bullied kid + gun access + media giviing mass shooters fame / fangirls = 3.5% chance of
being a school shooter
address bullying
keep guns away from your troubled kid
stop making murderers into heroes / antihereos / stop rewarding violence and stupidity"

1	"Most of the ""leaders"" of the alt right are directly connected to jews in some way.
Richard Spencer posed with jews and attended some synagogues or other congregations
of the jews before and is likely a CIA plant as previously suggested here.
Alex Jones (who is barely alt-right but the ZOG media will claim he is) legit admits to
being a juden:
Milo is of course jewish.
Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer contracted someone (who's cool as fuck) of the
jewish ethnicity to help significantly with building elements of his website, which is most
likely an unwitting infiltrated fbi honeypot by now like Stormfront is.
David Duke seems cool but I wouldn't be surprised if even he is kosher.
The alt-light is equivalent to reddit fags compared to dedicated 8ch pol posters, but is
still superior to neocons and most conservatives. The real alt-right meme is just a rehash
of the concept of Anonymous. Autists trying to claim they own that movement are the
reason why it's probably going to come crashing down in a few years; think Op-Chanology
2.0. The Alt-right is way better than (((neocon))) boomer fucks or neoliberal twats though.
A significant fuel source for infighting within the alt-right (as seen especially on
Daily Stormer and /pol/) is on the issue of women. I'd say on average 15~35% of the
communities to be white knights who put pussy on a pedestal. However, one of the major
ideas kicking off on DS is the idea of White Sharia; of severely oppressing thots and
restricting women's rights. This caused a clear divide in the community with the WKs
having to bow to the will of the majority and the thots in the audience making assclowns
of themselves before getting sent to the kitchen. Most alt-right communities, although
mostly similar, seem to hate other communities guts. /pol/ will talk shit about Daily
Stormer, which will talk shit about Stormfront, etc in a continuing cycle.
Feds usually try to trick aggressive twats into agreeing to acts or conspiracy of violence,
but I think all those clowns should do is to further fuel that divide to fuck the movement
up, something most alt-righters are doing to a small extent already. Regarding the issues
of the migrant crisis, kikery, feminazism, etc, the Alt-Right will definitely survive for
at least half a decade. It's not guaranteed to be the 4th Reich as of now, until another
civil war or civilizational collapse occurs. Granted that trolls boosted Trump into office,
anything is definitely possible."

1	Darn those idiots Don't they care care about the future of their race. Their like children everything has to be done for them. When are you going to grow up can't you aryans do anything by yourselfs. Darn those aryans. Maybe their not worth saving. Aryans of the world, RAISE YOUR HANDS UP RIGHT NOW OR YOUR ALL GOING TO DIE.
1	I then joined the Army, when I got to boot camp.Itwaslike that scene in Windtalkers.I have never been around so many white people. And you know what? They weren't the racist the media made them out to be. I then met actual white nationalist & that's when I became a full blown white supremcist. One of my white friend's actually said "I'm not a racist compared to you"
1	"Silver or Lead
No matter how well I think I can hide it. Their's always someone who see's right through me. The 1st was this. Out of the blue this fucking guy said you like the type to walk into a crowd and start shooting. Later I got the urge to watch Rampage. The Uwe Boll one not the video game one.
Another time this crew I worked with at BCW said in a joking way ""if you ever come in here and snap can you spare me?"" I think what gaveme away was I wear all black
I was 2 or 3 day's. When I came back everyone thought I had killed someone or raped some chick
And when I was at Texas Finishing Company this dude said Can you warn me when you go postal"
1	Maybe their not worth saving, Aryans of the World. RAISE YOUR HANDS UP RIGHT NOW OR YOUR ALL GOING TO DIE
1	I used to think of myself as Benny from The Sandlot. An all American kid who just happens to be not white. I m just a visitor. I m Hispanic whether I like it or not.
1	If the Aryans ever decide to take back America their not going to have a hard time. Every time I m about to fight another Hispanic just like umbrellas they fold 
1	One of my white friend s actually said, "I m not a racist compared to you"
1	Western man towers over everybody.
1	Their s no way in hell I would ever sleep w/ the women of a race I hated. Unless it was rape because rape is a special kind of evil.
1	"May 5 Friday 2023
Moons full loser's. See you in the morning"
1	Me testing out my toys.
1	You won't want to miss this one  It's going to be historic.
1	Goodbye humans I'll miss you 
1	2 hours to go 
1	unfortunately by the time most of you read this, I will be dead. I will die at age 24 and will be where I truly belong.
1	I'm a girl who's been trapped in a man's body for two and a half decades, and I need to get the hell out. I don't belong on this planet, nor have I ever. I need to die, and I'm taking whomever I can down with me.
1	I'm not just ending my life. I will be ending the lives of others as well.
1	It won't last.... It'll never last....
1	If I just laid down....
1	I should have listened.... You were right... The whole time you were right...
1	It breaks me... It actually does... I know it seems like I'm sweating it off... But I'm not.. And I never will be able to...
1	Alright. You fuckin got me.... That broke me
1	Fuuuucccckkkkkk you

1	Sick Of This Shit
1	Oh My God This Is So Fucking Stupid
1	"Tell me what your plan is....

1	"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people.
I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.
Screw your optics, I'm going in."
1	Daily reminder: Diversity means chasing down the last white person.
1	"I have noticed a change  in people saying 'illegals' that now say 'invaders'
I like this."
1	"Trump is a globalist, not a nationalist.
There is no #MAGA as long as there is a kike infestation.
#Qanon is here to get patriots that were against martial law in the 90's to be the ones begging for it now to drain muh swamp.
But go ahead and keep saying you are #Winning"

1	Jews are the children of Satan
1	the only good Jew is a dead Jew
1	"anyone looking for a 9x19 striker fired handgun? 
I recommend you take a look at the walther ppq. Amazing trigger.
Shots taken july 2017 from 27'. First shot was low."
1	"Maka be like:
""Q is the way, the truth and the LARP. No one comes to the MAGA but by him""
Also, you are still dodging my simply question.
Are you or are you not a jew?"
1	and this is why we can not let the kikes get any kind of foothold here
1	"If you re reading this then I m definitely DEAD and have just committed a  NATIONAL TRAGEDY.  I ve left this journal for all the investigators, Media, Internet Sleuths, etc. but most importantly this is for the VERY FEW people that I actually care about and want to understand why and how this happened so that they can be at peace. I m gonna lay it all out for you all so that by the end of all of this you will all understand why I did what I did. What you ll see here is the documentation and description of the Months, Weeks, Days from Today up until The Massacre.

Well then I guess I should tell you all a little bit about myself yeah? Not much that s noteworthy and most of the stuff about my birth and early life (Ahhhh back when things were much much simpler) is gonna be pretty easy to find. I ve changed A LOT since then, Obviously lol. The real changes started a little over two years ago when COVID first started to become a global thing. God that still f****** p***** me off.

I still cannot believe that the entire world fell for that. The virus itself was real and deadly but instead of actually coming up with a real solution to the problem they (meaning the Tyrannical U.S. GOVERNMENT) instead USED the problem to create mass hysteria and panic among us (Meaning the people of AMERICA) and then forced us into isolation and loneliness for a SIGNIFICANT amount of time.

I still haven t been able to pull myself out of that state. Despite numerous attempts at getting back into MMA, which I still love so dearly and always will, Despite numerous attempts at new jobs, despite numerous attempts at finding love once again, despite numerous attempts at being social and trying to make new friendships they have proved futile. So now we re here. I hope that this journal can give you all a sense of peace and closure. But the world has made this happen. I am responsible for this, but I was turned into a monster. I created this Tragedy. But Society created Me."
1	I CAN T WAIT ANY LONGER. The rage has become uncontrollable
1	Negroes have lower Iqs, lower impulse control, and higher testosterone levels in generals, These three things alone are a recipe for violent behavior.
1	if we could somehow destroy the jewish identity, then they wouldn t cause much of a problem
1	I hate with a passion the whole idea of the suburbs. To me it represents nothing but scared White people running. Running because they are too weak, scared and brainwashed to fight
1	I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charelston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no reaal KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me. 
1	The event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case. I kept hearing and seeing his name, and eventually I decided to look him up. I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right. But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words  black on White crime  into Google, and I have never been the same since that day.
1	Fuck this is going to be so shit but I can't wait any longer. Do your part and spread this brothers! Of course, only spread it if the attack is successful. I know that the media is going to try to frame my incorrectly, but y'all will know the truth! I'm probably going to die today. Keep up the good fight.
1	FML nervous as hell. This is the actual manifesto Fuck this is going to be so shit but I can't wait any longer. Do your part and spread this brothers! Of course, only spread it if the attack is successful. I know that the media is going to try to frame my incorrectly, but y'all will know the truth! I'm probably going to die today. Keep up the good fight.
1	People who I consider heroes and role models include (in no particular order): Brenton Tarrant, Payon Gendron, Otoya Yamaguchi, Anders Breivik, Henri Fenet, Jan Reznak, Izidor Kovarik, Robert Jay Mathews, Kiyoshi Ogawa, Robert Bowers, Adolf Eichmann and John T. Earnest.
1	It will be done.
1	I have made my decision.
1	#bratislava feeling no regrets, isn't that funny?
1	#bratislava #hatecrime #gaybar #bratislava
1	I'd do it all over again lmao
1	because I felt lke it
1	wish I could've gotten the chabad as well, oh well
1	2-1 kdr, not my problem. Wish I could've gone higher but whatever. Wanted to bag the prime minister but I didn't get lucky with his car arriving
1	Every human has to pick their path. I have chosen mine, the path of fight against the jewish enemies and their collaborators. I am satisfied with my path, I have no reservations. Therefore I am stepping forward without concern. There isn t a trace of fear or remorse in me. There are only two emotions within me: joy that such an opportunity to strike at the jewish occupied system is presented to me, and sorrow that I won t be alive long enough to see the world after the enemy has been defeated. This is my role in life, and I take this responsibility into my hands with joy and expectation.
1	I can no longer stand by and watch, while our people are being destroyed. Watch the jews work us over slowly, inflicting cut upon cut, slowly bleeding us out with their policies I must take a stand, even if just once in my life. Even if I must stand alone, even if just for one day, even if I may fail - I must do something. Because my people are worth fighting for I can t wait anymore. I must do what has to be done. I must fight back.
1	My main two inspirations to carry out an operation, and the main reason I even opened my eyes to the kikes and their plans and decided to resist them, were Brenton Tarrant and John Earnest When he posted his manifesto on the same website as Saint Tarrant - 8chan - I decided to check out what made the website so special, and from there on I was never the same.
1	Well lads, it is time to stop shitposting and time to make a real life effort post. I will carry out and attack against the invaders, and will even livestream the attack via facebook The facebook link is below, by the time you read this I should be going live. It's been a long ride and despite all your rampant faggotry, fecklessness and degeneracy you are all blokes and the best bunch of cobbers a man could ask for. I have provided links to my writings below, please do your part by spreading my messages, making memes and shitposting as you usually do. If I don' survive the attack, goodbye, godbless, and I will see you all in Valhalla!
1	It's been real dudes. From the bottom of my heart thank you for everything. Keep up the infographic redpill threads. I've only beeen lurking for a year and a half, yet what I've learned here is priceless. It's been an honor. Livestream link is below as well as my open letter. Livestream will begin shortly. Also in case they take down my livestream too soon and you don't get to hear all the awesome tunes I have planned - here they are. Very meme-able songs - you should have no problem. Meme magic is real. May the LORD Christ be with you all.
1	Target city pigs; target them at work and after work; target their families; target their children. Destroy the police stations; destroy their materiel; destroy their databases. If possible, strike deals with rural cops   you leave them alone, and they leave you alone. If not possible, the same as for city cops applies
1	"My name is John Earnest and I am a man of European ancestry. The blood that
runs in my veins is the same that ran through the English, Nordic, and Irish men of
old. I am a descendant of one of the original colonists of Roanoke John Earnest. What
happened to him I do not know, and nor does anyone. But I do know that he left his
wife and son, James Earnest, back in England. This son shortly after made the same
daring journey across the Atlantic to the New World. From my mother s side I
inherited the blood of very wealthy Yankees intelligent, resourceful, uncompromising.
From my father s side I inherited the blood of poor Southern farmers intelligent,
musically gifted, self-sufficient. A part of my ancestors lives within me in this
very moment. They are the reason that I am who I am. Their acts of bravery,
ingenuity, and righteousness live on through me. Truly, I am blessed by God for such
a magnificent bloodline."
1	"To my family and friends. I can already hear your voices.  How could you
throw your life away? You had everything! You had a loving family. You had great
friends. You had a church. You were doing well in nursing school. You could have gone
so far in your field of study. You could have made so much money and started a happy
family of your own.  I understand why you would ask this. But I pose a question to
you now. What value does my life have compared to the entirety of the European race?
Is it worth it for me to live a comfortable life at the cost of international Jewry
sealing the doom of my race? No. I will not sell my soul by sitting idly by as evil
grows. I d rather die in glory or spend the rest of my life in prison than waste away
knowing that I did nothing to stop this evil. It is not in my blood to be a coward. I
do not care about the debt-based currency that Jews like to pretend is money. I do
not care for the bread and circus that Jewry has used to attempt to pacify my people.
I willingly sacrifice my future the future of having a fulfilling job, a loving wife,
and amazing kids. I sacrifice this for the sake of my people. OUR people. I would die
a thousand times over to prevent the doomed fate that the Jews have planned for my
race."
1	"How does killing Jews help the European race? The European race is doomed?
What are you talking about? These Jews were innocent!  Every Jew is responsible for
the meticulously planned genocide of the European race. They act as a unit, and every
Jew plays his part to enslave the other races around him whether consciously or
subconsciously. Their crimes are endless. For lying and deceiving the public through
their exorbitant role in news media; for using usury and banks to enslave nations in
debt and control all finances for the purpose of funding evil; for their role in
starting wars on a foundation of lies which have costed millions of lives throughout
history; for their role in cultural Marxism and communism; for pushing degenerate
propaganda in the form of entertainment; for their role in feminism which has
enslaved women in sin; for causing many to fall into sin with their role in peddling
pornography; for their role in voting for and funding politicians and organizations
who use mass immigration to displace the European race; for their large role in every
slave trade for the past two-thousand years; for promoting race mixing; for their
cruel and bloody history of genocidal behavior; for their persecution of Christians
of old (including the prophets of ancient Israel Jeremiah, Isaiah, etc.), members of
the early church (Stephen whose death at the hands of the Jews was both heart-
wrenching and rage-inducing), Christians of modern-day Syria and Palestine, and
Christians in White nations; for their degenerate and abominable practices of sexual
perversion and blood libel (you are not forgotten Simon of Trent, the horror that you
and countless children have endured at the hands of the Jews will never be forgiven);
for not speaking about these crimes; for not attempting to stop the members of their
race from committing them. And finally, for their role in the murder of the Son of
Man that is the Christ. Every Jew young and old has contributed to these. For these
crimes they deserve nothing but hell."
1	I will send them there.
1	"Why are you doing this? Surely killing a fraction of Jews will not solve
any problems. Are there not better ways to save the European race?  Yes and no. There
are three roles that must be played in this revolution. Those who spread the truth,
those who defend the race, and those who continue the race (having children). Where
most people misunderstand is that all three of these must be performed by everyone to
the best of his ability. There has been little done when it comes to defending the
European race. As an individual I can only kill so many Jews. My act of defense is
not so much about my high score that is how many Jews I can  Do not pass go, do not
collect 200 shekels  straight to fucking hell. But rather the statement that I made.
There is at least one European man alive who is willing to take a stand against the
injustice that the Jew has inflicted upon him. That my act will inspire others to
take a stand as well. And when this revolution starts gaining traction (if I am not
killed) I expect to be freed from prison and continue the fight. I do not seek fame.
I do not seek power. I only wish to inspire others and be a soldier that has the
honor and privilege of defending his race in its greatest hour of need and have a
family if possible."
1	"How can you call yourself a Christian and do this? Surely the Bible calls
for you to love your enemies?  Firstly, just because someone calls themselves a
Christian does not make them one. Plenty of people wrongfully identify with being
Christian. Beyond the scope of time the Father and the Son made a covenant in
eternity that the Son would bring a people to Him that He may be glorified through
them. I did not choose to be a Christian. The Father chose me. The Son saved me. And
the Spirit keeps me. Why me? I do not know. And my answer to loving my enemies? Trust
yids and their puppet braindead lemming normalfags to take one quote from the Bible
and grossly twist its meaning to serve their own evil purposes meanwhile ignoring the
encompassing history and context of the entire Bible and the wisdom it takes to apply
God s law in a broken world. Is it lawful to let a thief murder my friend instead of
killing the thief to prevent the death of my friend? To ask such a question is to
answer it. It is not loving towards your friend to let him be murdered. It is not
loving towards your enemy the thief to let him murder. A child can understand the
concept of self-defense. It is unlawful and cowardly to stand on the sidelines as the
European people are genocided around you. I did not want to have to kill Jews. But
they have given us no other option. I m just a normal dude who wanted to have a
family, help and heal people, and play piano. But the Jew with his genocidal
instincts is insistent on poking the bear until it tears his head off. The Jew has
forced our hand, and our response is completely justified. My God does not take
kindly to the destruction of His creation. Especially one of the most beautiful,
intelligent, and innovative races that He has created. Least of all at the hands of
one of the most ugly, sinful, deceitful, cursed, and corrupt. My God understands why
I did what I did."
1	"When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was
made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent
of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. Then answered all the people, and
said, His blood be on us, and on our children  (Matthew 27:24-25)."
1	" know that ye are Abraham s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word
hath no place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that
which ye have seen with your father. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our
father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham s children, ye would do the works
of Abraham [ ] Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will
do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there
is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar,
and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not  (John
8:37-45)."
1	"For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea
are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen,
even as they have of the Jews: Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own
prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all
men: Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up
their sins away: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost  (1 Thessalonians
2:14-16)."
1	"I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I
know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the
synagogue of Satan  (Revelation 2:9)."
1	"Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are
Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before
thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee  (Revelation 3:9)."
1	"Hey you, you re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right?
Walked right into that Imperial ambush. Same as us, and that thief over there.  (I
forget where in the Bible this verse comes from, but it s definitely in there)."
1	"To the glow-niggers and Jewed-media reading this. I think it is important
for you to know that I did not do this alone. I had the help of a man named Felix
Arvid Ulf Kjellberg. He was kind enough to plan and fund this whole operation the sly
bastard. Apparently, Pewdiepie hates Jews as much as Pajeets. Who would ve known?
Make sure to call me a  white supremacist  and  anti-semite  or whatever bullshit you
spew to spook the normalfags. It doesn t even matter. You ve been calling every White
person alive those names for decades they ve lost all their meaning. You ve socially
ostracized every White person. You ve made it harder and harder for White people to
live a normal life. To this I say well done. You are stupid enough to make a White
person s only viable option for survival to kill all of you. Keep doing what you re
doing Jew-media. You re putting the noose around your own neck. The irony is
glorious."
1	"To my brothers in blood. Make sure that my sacrifice was not in vain. Spread
this letter, make memes, shitpost, FIGHT BACK, REMEMBER ROBERT BOWERS, REMEMBER
BRENTON TARRANT, filter the religious D&C, and filter the schizos who will inevitably
call this a  false flag.  Something to note, people grossly overestimate the police s
ability to solve  crimes  such as  arson  and  murder.  Lots of threads about  Feds
are talking to me guys because I post on 8chan, it s so spooky  are  organically 
popping up. What a load of shit meant to try to scare the goyim and prevent
retaliation. I scorched a mosque in Escondido with gasoline a week after Brenton
Tarrant s sacrifice and they never found shit on me (I didn t realize sandniggers
were sleeping inside though they woke up and put out the fire pretty much immediately
after I drove away which was unfortunate. Also they didn t report the message I
spray-painted on the parking lot. I wrote  For Brenton Tarrant -t. /pol/ ). It is so
easy to log on to Minecraft and get away with burning a synagogue (or mosque) to the
ground if you re smart about it. You can even shoot up a mosque, synagogue,
immigration center, traitorous politicians, wealthy Jews in gated communities,
Jewish-owned company buildings, etc. and get away with it as well. If your goal is
strictly carnage and the highest score I d highly recommend you look into
flamethrowers (remember kids, napalm is more effective than gasoline if you want Jews
to really light up like a menorah). I know you re out there Fire-anon make us proud.
Don t leave DNA (use clothes you ve never worn before and a mask dispose of these
after). Don t bring any electronics which can be used to track you. Don t leave a
paper trail. Don t take too long doing it, and never speak of it (all electronics are
bugged). Again, I m talking about Minecraft. You do not have to  televise  like I did
and get caught. As more of these happen, we will no longer need to film it. I do
believe that it is best at this stage that I make a statement and people know that I
did this. We are in the early stages of revolution. We need martyrs. If you don t
want to get caught because you have children who depend on you, you can simply attack
a target and then slip back into normal life. Every anon reading this needs to carry
out attacks. They won t find us. They won t catch us. There are too many of us, and
we are smarter than them."
1	"Remember that fear is the only thing holding you back. Fear that you might
lose everything in your life. I am a testament to the fact that literally anyone can
do this, and this terrifies the Jew. I m a 19 year old nursing student from the
depths of Commiefornia for fuck s sake. I had my whole life ahead of me. If you told
me even 6 months ago that I would do this I would have been surprised. Meme Robert
Bowers back and keep up the memes of Brenton Tarrant. Tarrant was a catalyst for me
personally. He showed me that it could be done. And that it needed to be done.  WHY
WON T SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING? WHY WON T SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING? WHY DON T I DO
SOMETHING?  the most powerful words in his entire manifesto. Any White man rich or
poor, young or old who is brave enough can take any action he wants against the
tyrannical and genocidal Jew. You should be more afraid of losing your entire race
than this life you now live. The most dangerous kind of man is not one who has
nothing to lose, but one who has everything to lose. Every single White man has
everything to lose by doing nothing, and everything to gain by taking action."
1	"Anyone who denounces violent self-defense against the Jew is a coward. He
may know the crimes of the Jew, but subconsciously he knows that ACTUALLY taking
action would mean sacrificing the bread and circus. It might mean that he won t live
comfortably anymore. This is one of the reasons cowards so shrilly screech that
Brenton Tarrant and Robert Bowers were Mossad false flag operations. They can t
fathom that there are brave White men alive who have the willpower and courage it
takes to say,  Fuck my life I m willing to sacrifice everything for the benefit of my
race.  He projects his own cowardice onto the White race. To the coward it is just a
hobby. He is a LARPfag and a traitor. Ignore him. He has nothing useful to offer.
That or it s just a Jew shilling,  Don t oppose us.  Or possibly a schizo boomer off
his meds. It s a shame that Robert Bowers especially got such a bad rap due to the
inordinate amount of schizofags and flat-earth-tier-tards on /pol/ right now. Brenton
Tarrant inspired me. I hope to inspire many more. To those who are brave know that
your sacrifice is the greatest act of love for your race. Your sacrifice will be
remembered. Always."
1	KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING. IT S FUCKING HAPPENING. McFuggen ebin. :DDD
1	Lightning round.
1	 Are you a Trump supporter? 
1	"You mean that Zionist, Jew-loving, anti-White, traitorous cocksucker? Don t
make me laugh."
1	 Are you affiliated with any political ideology? 
1	Yes. It s called not wanting to go extinct.
1	 Are you a conservative? 
1	"I am not a useless, spineless coward so no I am not a conservative.
Conservative is a misnomer. They conserve nothing. They ll complain all they want but
they won t take up arms and threaten their government with death (the only thing that
works). Ever heard about the Battle of Athens (1946)? Find your balls again you
insufferable faggots. If you do not defend your rights you deserve none."
1	 Are you a terrorist? 
1	"Well, let s walk through this question together shall we? I m not wearing
the sandnigger equivalent of a durag, my skin isn t the color of shit, you can t
smell me from across the room, it is socially unacceptable for me to marry my
cousins, I do not shout  Durka durka mohammed jihad,  and it doesn t look like a
sadist attempted to play tug-of-war with my nose. So no, I m not a terrorist."
1	 Do you feel any remorse for what you did? 
1	"The Jews have depleted our patience and our mercy. I feel no remorse. I only
wish I killed more. I am honored to be the one to send these vile anti-humans into
the pit of fire where they shall remain for eternity."
1	 Do you feel anything but hatred for Jews? 
1	"Disgust. Disgust that a race can become so unrecognizably corrupted that
they would commit the most heinous acts that only the most twisted of individuals
could put into reality."
1	 Are you insane/crazy? 
1	"I ve seen plenty of mentally ill patients. It s heartbreaking and I know
what it looks like. No, I do not have mental illness. However, I know the Jew would
love to claim that to discredit me. In his mind you must be insane to oppose him."
1	 Do you hate all Jews? 
1	"I hate anyone who seeks the destruction of my race. Every Jew currently
alive plays a part in the destruction of my race. Does that answer your question?"
1	 Do you hate other races? 
1	"I hate anyone who seeks the destruction of my race. Spics and niggers are
useful puppets for the Jew in terms of replacing Whites. Of course, they aren t
intelligent enough to realize that the Jew is using them and they will be enslaved if
Europeans are eliminated. Do they actively hate my race? Yes, I hate them. Are they
in my nation but do not hate my race? I do not hate them, but they aren t staying.
Are they out of my nation and do not hate my race? Fine by me."
1	 Why so much hatred? 
1	"There is no love without hatred. You cannot love God if you do not hate
Satan. You cannot love righteousness if you do not also hate sin. You cannot love
your own race if you do not hate those who wish to destroy it. Love and hate are two
sides of the same coin. I may be filled with hatred, but I am also filled with love.
Most people are empty inside unspiritual and shameful dopamine fiends devoid of all
love, honor, and purpose. I cannot imagine a more pathetic existence."
1	" Why did you use guns instead of a flamethrower? Wouldn t a flamethrower
have given you a much higher score?"""
1	"Yes. I encourage you to use flamethrowers as well as guns. Use what you
think would be best in your situation. I used a gun for the same reason that Brenton
Tarrant used a gun. In case you haven t noticed we are running out of time. If this
revolution doesn t happen soon, we won t have the numbers to win it. The goal is for
the US government to start confiscating guns. People will defend their right to own a
firearm civil war has just started. Stop the slow boil of the frog prevent the Jew
from using incrementalism. Make the Jew play all of his cards to make it apparent to
more people how their rights are being taken away right before their eyes."
1	 Did your family cause you to think this way? 
1	"Unfortunately, no. I had to learn what they should have taught me from the
beginning."
1	 Was it your plan to live or die? 
1	"If I die I die. I do not care if I die, but I will not sin against my God
and murder myself. I plan on living (only you know the outcome)."
1	 How long did it take you to plan this attack? 
1	"Four weeks. Four weeks ago, I decided that I was doing this. Four weeks
later I did it. I remember a specific moment in time after Brenton Tarrant s
sacrifice that something just clicked in my mind.  If I won t defend my race, how can
I expect others to do the same?  I immediately got to planning, and I never looked
back. I never had doubts. I never felt afraid. I never felt anxious just the
occasional nervous excitement."
1	 Who inspires you? 
1	"Jesus Christ, the Apostle Paul, Martin Luther, Adolf Hitler, Robert Bowers,
Brenton Tarrant, Ludwig van Beethoven, Moon Man, and Pink Guy."
1	 How long have you been playing piano? 
1	"Ever since I was 4. It was my favorite thing to do then. It is my favorite
thing to do now. However, killing Jews might change that I ll get back to you on that
one."
1	 What is your favorite song to play? 
1	Scherzo No. 2 by Chopin without a doubt.
1	"To my brothers in Christ of all races. Be strong. Although the Jew who is
inspired by demons and Satan will attempt to corrupt your soul with the sin and
perversion he spews remember that you are secure in Christ. Turn away from your sin.
Not because it is required for your salvation for nobody save Christ can merit heaven
based on his own works but rather out of gratitude for the gift of salvation that
your God has given you. Always remember that it is God that is keeping you alive and
in faith. All sin stems from the arrogant belief that one does not need God. Satan
was so prideful that he actually truly believed (that he, a created being) could
overthrow the Ancient of Days the Creator of all in existence. Satan inspired this
rebellion among humanity. Christ alone is the only source of life. Know that you are
saved in Christ and nothing not death, nor torture, nor sin can steal your soul away
from God."
1	"To the Jew. Your crimes innumerable. Your deeds unacceptable. Your lies 
everywhere. The European man will rise up and strike your squalid and parasitic race
into the dust. And this time there will be nowhere for you to run."
1	And last but definitely not least.
1	"To the true anons out there (you know who you are). You are the product of
/pol/ the product of unadulterated truth. You are my brothers and the best dudes out
there. You are the most honorable men of this age. Despite all odds against you, you
not only discovered the truth but also help to spread it. Some of you have been
waiting for The Day of the Rope for years. Well, The Day of the Rope is here right
now that is if you have the gnads to keep the ball rolling. Every anon reading this
must attack a target while doing his best to avoid getting caught. Every anon must
play his part in this revolution and no man can be pulling his punches. This momentum
we currently have may very well be the last chance that the European man has to spark
a revolution."
1	"Despite this I m not worried. I have complete trust and certainty that all
of you after reading this will begin planning your attack on the enemy and you ll
attack again, and again, and again until either we win, or we die. I know you will do
this because you re true anons. You re White men. I m not worried that the whole
world is against you. I m not worried because you are the greatest race that our God
has created it is our duty to keep this world from falling into darkness. White men
will not let God s creation be corrupted and destroyed by the Jew without a fight.
Remember your honor White men."
1	"More than anything I wish I could ve seen your faces and fought alongside
with you on the battlefield."
1	Give them hell for me.
1	Give. Them. Hell.
